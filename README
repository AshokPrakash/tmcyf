Deployment

Live at: http://dev.tmcyf.org/ or http://ec2-184-73-116-177.compute-1.amazonaws.com/

To make shit work: 

1. checkout branch
2. ask for file with env vars nicely
3. run cap rubber:refresh to add host to local host file

Recommended workflow:

1. make changes in develop
2. merge with deploy (should have zero conflicts)
3. run cap deploy
